/* Pseudocode:
***************Done*********************
DONE!!! Create a function that will return random assets:
- images
- titles
- quotes
DONE!!! We will need to use the getRandomIndex function to choose each random asset
NOPE - didn't need this because we just had to call the function to getRandomIndex and then populate that into an Objecty (We think we will need three separate for loops to run through the three different arrays)
**********************************************

Then, we will use the object from "getPosterAssets" to populate the arguments of the createPoster function (imageURL, title, quote) - will need to use an event listener as well

We have to do something with the outome of the object in "getPosterAssets" to convert the random index number to the string associated with that index number

We need to create another function that uses .innerHTML and .innerText, to change the values of the poster - will use .src to target the image URL

// function randomCover() {
//   randomPosterImg.innerText = getPosterAssets(randomAssetGroup.randomImage)
} */
