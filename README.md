# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
Hang in There is a website for users to create and save motivational posters. Each poster is made up of:

 - A Title
 - An Image
 - A motivational quote

 This website is helping address the problem of emotional well-being by providing a way for users to target an area where they need motivation and create a poster that can help refocus their perspective.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We have completed 2 weeks of instruction in Turing. We spent approximately 24 hours in paired programming and additional 15 hours each doing research, working with other cohort members, and learning about unfamiliar concepts.

### Learning Goals:
#### The Learning Goals of this project were:
 - Write clean, DRY JavaScript
 - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
 - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
 - Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
 - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
 - Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively
 - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
 - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
 - Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project

 #### The technologies we used were:
  - Macbooks
  - Chrome browser
  - Terminal
  - VS Code
  - Developer Tools
    - Console
    - Events Tab
  - GitHub
  - Git
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Challenges:
  - We spent SO much time struggling with the Git Workflow. We realized very early on that the instructors were not kidding when they said we would make mistakes. We kept forgetting the make branches and we would get so caught up in our paired programming, that we would forget to commit early and often. This was definitely a learning process for us. We got over this challenge by holding each other accountable to checking the Git Workflow document. We walked through that flow together for the creation of each branch and all of our pushes and pull.
  - Struggled with the hide and remove functions - were not originally clear on why the for loop seemed to work better than creating individual function. We got over this by checking with our rocks and getting advice from them on how to think about the problem and refactor our code.
 - Struggled with the .remove function for saved posters page. Originally we were trying to remove posters without a for loop. We checked with a rock on this to get advice.

 #### Wins:
   - We learned how to use the Developer Tools Console to target an event, to which we were able to apply the .remove function.
   - We tried to hide elements without a for loop, but were only able to take in one value, instead of multiple values. In our code, on line 231, we were able to pass through two elements because of the for loop, which made our code more DRY. Without the for loop on the show and hide functions, we would have been repeating code.
   - We were able to successfully use innerHTML and target CSS classes, which was something we had not done before or learned about yet. This solution came from research Alice did.
   - We believe our collaboration worked really well and was a big win for us. We talked through our code and made sure we were both understanding what we were doing. When we did outside research we would come back together and review that research and then decide together how to apply it. We practiced paired programming for all features and traded off navigating and driving. We were also very proactive about our communication and made time to meet with each other.

   ## Questions for our Project Manager
   We had several questions, but were able to get most of them answered by our rocks. Please reference [Questions for Hang In There - Alice/Jan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChKadZJxREGSlEhssxDaWTrznA-LqCEbfPnjU3Fdqgw/edit?usp=sharing)
